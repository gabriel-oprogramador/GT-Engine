# GT-Engine
My non-generalist Game Engine.  
This engine will only have the base code for creating games and everything in it will be done from scratch without using any third-party libraries for further learning, only the APIs offered by the supported operating systems and OpenGL.  

# Note
Support Platform => Windows(true) and Linux(true)   
GCC or Clang compilers, if you use GCC you don't need to download Clang because W64devkit already comes with GCC.  
Set the compiler in the Makefile.  

# Dependencies
For Windows  
W64devkit -> https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit  
Clang -> https://releases.llvm.org/download.html  
For Linux  
GCC or Clang, Gnu-Make, EGL, OpenGL
